# Security Cam Storage for App Engine
A little manager for low res pictures from a security cam

The system receive by email the low res picture.
In this version I added a POST to IFTTT so I can have the last picture as notify on my android wear.
The "/last" show me the last picture in the datastore

I will add a page in JS to display always the last picture (just refreshing the picture every 10 secs).
